#### 📊 Production Features
- **Certificate loading**: Support for PEM/DER certificates and private keys
- **Connection migration**: Seamless WiFi ↔ cellular network switching
- **0-RTT connections**: Instant reconnection for repeat connections
- **Stream multiplexing**: Multiple independent streams over single connection
- **Flow control**: Built-in congestion control and bandwidth management

### Technical Details

#### API Coverage
- ✅ **Core API**: Complete 1:1 Quinn library mapping
- ✅ **Convenience API**: HTTP-style wrapper for common use cases
- ✅ **Client operations**: Full client-side QUIC functionality
- ✅ **Server operations**: Complete server-side QUIC implementation
- ✅ **Certificate management**: TLS certificate loading and validation

#### Performance Features
- **Head-of-line blocking elimination**: Independent stream processing

- **HTTP/3 semantics**: Raw QUIC transport only (HTTP/3 helpers planned)
- **Advanced TLS**: Custom certificate validation not yet implemented

### Dependencies
- `quinn = "0.11"` - Core QUIC implementation
- `flutter_rust_bridge = "2.11.1"` - Rust-Flutter integration
- `tokio` - Async runtime for Rust operations
- `rustls` - TLS 1.3 implementation

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)
